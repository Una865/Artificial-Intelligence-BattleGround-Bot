# Artificial-Intelligence-BattleGround-PlayerBot

The task for the playerBot and rules of the game:

It was a foggy and quiet night we hadn't seen in months.
Shipwrecks, planks and remnants of ship's equipment could be seen for miles away from the scene of the clash. After a battle that will be remembered as the biggest pirate skirmish in history, the turbulent sea has finally returned to balance.
Captain Vukobradi used to be the scariest pirate in the Stormy Sea. He had the largest and fastest ship, with the strongest, most ruthless crew. The treasure he stole after the fateful battle was invaluable.
The battle is over, but at what cost?
The fleet on both sides was blown to pieces.
In addition to the many lives lost, the Captain knew that he did not have much time left before the next battle. As soon as word of his weakened crew spread, other pirate captains would seize the opportunity. The desire not to lose his reputation, respect and his treasure pushed him into a corner. He had to act fast.
Pirate voyages were full of dangers, both from the open sea and from wild, mysterious creatures that need to be dealt with. After so many years on the high seas, the Captain knew the sea like a little finger. He knew exactly where and in what way to bury the treasure so that it would not be found, which he did.
Then ... several small waves lapped the Captain's ship. That was it!
When a storm strikes, every captain will become greedy and eager for destruction, which is an ideal time to attack.
Any rival ship can easily sneak up on you in these unfavorable conditions.
Help your crew find lost treasure and become the most notorious fleet on the high seas.

AI Battleground 2021 is a TBS (Turn Based Strategy) game in which four artificial intelligences take on the role and powers of an avatar to fight for victory. The moves take place in order, from the first to the fourth player.
You are on a sea of **hexagonal shape**, 29 diagonals long, and you can't get out of it. The map is of **constant size**. The game can last a maximum of **5000** moves, ie. 1250 moves per player.
Gold coins (points) can be won in several ways. At all times, there is a flag on the map. The player who reaches her first wins the flag, as well as the gold coins she hides. In addition, the player can win gold by eliminating opponents or NPCs (Non-Playable Characters).
The task is to create a computer program that will play the game as one of the pirate ships, as intelligently as possible, by sending requests to the server and obtaining server responses in JSON format.

Maps are generated depending on the round of the competition. The closer you get to the finals, the harder the map gets. The map is fair to all players.
